# Inference

## Single-Location Prediction

The `predict.py` script predicts which species are likely to occur at a given location and week:

```bash
python predict.py --lat 52.5 --lon 13.4 --week 22
```

Output (sorted by probability):

```
Species                         Common Name                     Probability
Turdus merula                   Eurasian Blackbird              0.9824
Parus major                     Great Tit                       0.9651
Sylvia atricapilla              Eurasian Blackcap               0.9203
...
```

## CLI Reference

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--lat` | required | Latitude (-90 to 90) |
| `--lon` | required | Longitude (-180 to 180) |
| `--week` | required | Week number (1–48) |
| `--checkpoint` | `checkpoints/checkpoint_best.pt` | Model checkpoint |
| `--top_k` | — | Show only the top K species |
| `--threshold` | — | Show only species above this probability |
| `--device` | `auto` | `auto`, `cuda`, or `cpu` |

If neither `--top_k` nor `--threshold` is specified, all species are shown sorted by probability.

## Programmatic Usage

```python
from predict import predict

results = predict(
    checkpoint_path='checkpoints/checkpoint_best.pt',
    lat=52.5, lon=13.4, week=22,
    threshold=0.1,
)

for taxon_key, scientific_name, common_name, prob in results:
    print(f"{common_name}: {prob:.3f}")
```

The `predict()` function returns a list of `(taxonKey, scientificName, commonName, probability)` tuples, sorted by probability descending.

## Checkpoint Format

A checkpoint `.pt` file contains:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `model_state_dict` | Model weights |
| `optimizer_state_dict` | Optimizer state (for resuming training) |
| `model_config` | Dict with `model_size`, `n_species`, `n_env_features`, `coord_harmonics`, `week_harmonics` |
| `species_vocab` | Dict with `species_to_idx` and `idx_to_species` mappings |
| `epoch` | Training epoch at save time |
| `best_val_loss` | Best validation loss seen |
| `history` | Full training history |
| `scheduler_state_dict` | LR scheduler state (if used) |
| `scaler_state_dict` | AMP scaler state (if CUDA) |

## Labels File

The `labels.txt` file (saved alongside checkpoints) maps model output indices to species:

```
2488027	Turdus merula	Eurasian Blackbird
9596869	Parus major	Great Tit
...
```

Format: `taxonKey<TAB>scientificName<TAB>commonName`, one line per species in vocabulary order.

## How Inference Works

1. The raw `(lat, lon, week)` values are wrapped in tensors
2. The model's `CircularEncoding` converts them to sine/cosine harmonics internally
3. The shared encoder produces a spatial-temporal embedding
4. Only the species prediction head runs (environmental head is skipped)
5. Sigmoid is applied to get probabilities per species
6. Results are sorted by probability and optionally filtered

!!! note "No preprocessing required"
    Unlike many geospatial models, this model handles all encoding internally. You don't need to normalize coordinates, look up environmental features, or preprocess inputs in any way.
