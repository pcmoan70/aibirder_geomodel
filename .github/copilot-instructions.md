# BirdNET Geomodel Project

## Project Overview
This project builds a spatiotemporal species occurrence prediction model for bird species using H3 geospatial cells and temporal information.

## Data Structure

### Dataset (Parquet files)
Each row represents an H3 cell and contains:
- **h3_index**: H3 geospatial hexagonal grid cell identifier
- **Environmental features**: Multiple geographic/environmental attributes for the cell (elevation, climate data, land cover, etc.)
  - May contain NaN values (handled via masked MSE loss during training)
- **48 week columns** (week_1 through week_48): Each column contains a list of GBIF taxonKeys representing bird species observed in that cell during that specific week of the year

### GBIF TaxonKeys
Species identifiers from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) taxonomy system. Used to represent which bird species were observed.

## Model Architecture & Approach

### Multi-Task Learning Setup

**Model Inputs:**
- **Spatial location**: Latitude and longitude (converted from H3 cells)
  - Uses **multi-harmonic circular encoding** for neural network compatibility
  - Each coordinate → [sin(θ), cos(θ), sin(2θ), cos(2θ), …, sin(nθ), cos(nθ)]
  - Default `coord_harmonics=8` → 16 features per coordinate (32 total for lat+lon)
  - Preserves spherical continuity (e.g., -180° and 180° longitude map to same point)
- **Temporal**: Week number (1-48)
  - Uses **multi-harmonic circular encoding** for cyclical representation
  - Default `week_harmonics=4` → 8 features
  - Ensures week 48 and week 1 are treated as adjacent
  - Temporal signal modulates spatial embedding via **FiLM conditioning**
    (Feature-wise Linear Modulation: γ × spatial + β per residual block)

**Total Input Features**: 32 spatial (lat+lon) + 8 temporal (week FiLM)

**Training Targets:**
- **Primary target**: Species list (GBIF taxonKeys) for that location/week combination
  - Encoded as multi-label binary classification
  - Asymmetric Loss (ASL, default) with separate positive/negative focusing
  - BCE, focal, and assume-negative (AN) loss also available via `--species_loss`
- **Auxiliary target**: Environmental/geographic features for that cell
  - The environmental features act as a regularization signal
  - Helps the model learn better spatial representations
  - Encourages the model to implicitly capture environmental patterns
  - MSE loss for regression

**Inference:**
- Only predict species lists for a given location (lat/lon) and week
- Environmental features are NOT used as input or predicted during inference
- The model relies on learned patterns from coordinates and temporal information
- Yearly (week 0) predictions: max of predictions across all 48 weeks

### Key Design Principles
1. Environmental data is used during training only (as auxiliary targets, not inputs)
2. The model must learn to encode spatial and temporal patterns from coordinates + week alone
3. Multi-harmonic circular encoding of lat/lon and weeks ensures proper handling in neural networks
4. Auxiliary environmental prediction helps the model learn meaningful spatial representations
5. At inference time, only (latitude, longitude, week) → species predictions are made

## Implementation Details

### Data Pipeline (`utils/`)

**data.py** - H3DataLoader class:
- Loads parquet files using GeoPandas
- Converts H3 cells to lat/lon coordinates using h3 library
- Flattens H3 cell × week combinations into individual training samples (48 weeks + 1 yearly per cell)
- Extracts environmental features and species lists

**data.py** - H3DataPreprocessor class:
- `normalize_environmental_features()`: Normalizes env features with StandardScaler
  - Categorical columns → one-hot encoded (NaN → all-zero row)
  - Fraction columns → passed through as-is (NaN → 0)
  - Continuous columns → StandardScaler (NaN positions preserved for masked MSE loss)
- `build_species_vocabulary()`: Creates vocabulary of all unique GBIF taxonKeys
- `encode_species_multilabel()`: Converts species lists to multi-label dense binary matrix
- `encode_species_sparse()`: Converts species lists to sparse index arrays (used when dense would exceed 8 GiB)
- `prepare_training_data()`: Complete preprocessing pipeline
  - Supports `max_obs_per_species` to cap common species observations
  - Supports `min_obs_per_species` to exclude rare species (default 100)
- `compute_species_freq_weights()`: Per-species label weights based on observation frequency
  - Treats range (number of occupied cells) as a proxy for abundance
  - Common species (>=95th percentile) -> weight 1.0; rare (<=5th pct) -> min_weight (default 0.1)
  - Sigmoid-shaped interpolation between percentiles; stored as `self.species_freq_weights`
- `compute_obs_density()`: Per-sample observation density (total species detections
  at each location across all weeks). Serves as a proxy for observer effort.
  Stored in `inputs['obs_density']` and used for density-stratified validation metrics.
- `mask_regions()`: Split data into in-region (holdout) and out-of-region (train)
  subsets by geographic bounding boxes. Returns (outside_inputs, outside_targets,
  inside_inputs, inside_targets).
- `split_data()`: Location-based train/val/test splitting to prevent data leakage
- `subsample_by_location()`: Randomly subsample a fraction of locations (and all
  their samples). Preserves temporal structure within each H3 cell.
- `subsample_by_samples()`: Randomly subsample a fraction of individual
  week@location rows. Used when dropping entire locations is undesirable
  (e.g. small islands with endemic species).

**data.py** - PyTorch Dataset:
- `BirdSpeciesDataset`: PyTorch Dataset wrapper with sparse-to-dense conversion
  - Optional `jitter_std` (degrees) adds Gaussian noise to lat/lon on each draw
  - Optional `species_freq_weights` applies per-species label weights (training only)
  - Lat clamped to [-90, 90], lon wrapped at ±180°
  - Sparse path returns raw index arrays; dense vector built in batch collate_fn
- `create_dataloaders()`: Creates training and validation DataLoaders
  - Accepts `jitter_std`; applied to training set only (val is never jittered)
  - Accepts `species_freq_weights`; applied to training set only
  - Uses custom `collate_fn` for sparse species (builds dense tensor per batch)
  - `persistent_workers=True` when `num_workers > 0`
  - Callers subsample by location before calling (see `subsample_by_location`)

**geoutils.py**: Google Earth Engine feature extraction for H3 cells
**gbifutils.py**: GBIF species occurrence data retrieval (parallel processing with multiprocessing pool)
**combine.py**: Merges Earth Engine features with GBIF observations into a single parquet
**regions.py**: Holdout region definitions and resolution
- `HOLDOUT_REGIONS` dict: 5 well-surveyed regions (us_northwest, benelux, uk, california, japan)
  as (lon_min, lat_min, lon_max, lat_max) bounding boxes
- `resolve_holdout_regions(names)`: Resolves region name strings to bbox tuples

### Model Architecture (`model/`)

**model.py** - Neural Network Architecture:

1. **CircularEncoding**: Multi-harmonic encoding for periodic values
   - Input: scalar angle θ
   - Output: [sin(θ), cos(θ), sin(2θ), cos(2θ), …, sin(nθ), cos(nθ)]
   - Output dim = 2 × n_harmonics per scalar

2. **ResidualBlock**: Pre-norm residual block
   - LayerNorm(eps=1e-4) → GELU → Linear → LayerNorm(eps=1e-4) → GELU → Dropout → Linear + skip connection
   - eps=1e-4 keeps epsilon above the FP16 min-normal (~6e-5) for quantisation safety

3. **SpatioTemporalEncoder**: Shared encoder with FiLM temporal conditioning
   - Spatial: lat→16, lon→16 = 32 features → Linear projection to embed_dim
   - Temporal: week→8 features → per-block FiLM generators produce (γ, β)
   - Residual blocks modulated by FiLM: block(x) * γ + β
   - Output: embed_dim-dimensional embedding (default 512)

4. **SpeciesPredictionHead**: Multi-label classification head (primary task)
   - Residual blocks + low-rank bottleneck output
   - Default: 512 → residual blocks × 2 → bottleneck(128) → n_species
   - Output: Logits for each species (apply sigmoid for probabilities)

5. **EnvironmentalPredictionHead**: Regression head (auxiliary task)
   - Residual blocks + linear output
   - Default: 256 → residual blocks × 1 → n_env_features
   - Output: Predicted environmental feature values (training only)

6. **BirdNETGeoModel**: Complete multi-task model
   - Combines all components
   - Forward pass returns both species logits and environmental predictions (training)
   - Inference mode skips environmental prediction for efficiency
   - `predict_species()`: Convenience method for binary predictions
   - `get_species_probabilities()`: Get occurrence probabilities

**Model Scaling:**
- Continuous `model_scale` factor (default 1.0)
- scale=0.5 → ~1.8M parameters, embed_dim=256, encoder: 2 blocks
- scale=1.0 → ~7.2M parameters, embed_dim=512, encoder: 4 blocks (default)
- scale=2.0 → ~36M parameters, embed_dim=1024, encoder: 8 blocks

**loss.py** - Loss Functions:
- `asymmetric_loss()`: Default loss — ASL (Ridnik et al., 2021) for multi-label classification
  - Separate focusing: γ+=0 (keep all positives), γ-=2 (suppress easy negatives)
  - Probability margin clip=0.05 discards very easy negatives
- `AssumeNegativeLoss`: LAN-full strategy (Cole et al., 2023) for presence-only data
  - Up-weights positives by λ, samples M negatives per example
  - Default: λ=4, M=1024, label_smoothing=0.05
- `MultiTaskLoss`: Weighted combination of species loss + environmental MSE
  - Total Loss = species_weight × species_loss + env_weight × MSE
  - Species loss: `asl` (default), `bce`, `focal`, or `an` (assume-negative)
  - Default weights: species=1.0, env=0.1
  - Environmental MSE uses `masked_mse()` to skip NaN targets
- `compute_pos_weights()`: Calculate class weights from training data
- `focal_loss()`: Alternative loss for severe class imbalance

### Training Pipeline (`train.py`)

**Trainer class:**
- Complete training loop with validation
- Automatic mixed precision (AMP) on CUDA
- Gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0) to prevent exploding gradients
- Linear LR warmup (3 epochs) + CosineAnnealingLR schedule (single decay, no restarts)
- Early stopping with configurable patience (default 10), based on validation mAP
- Checkpoint management:
  - `checkpoint_latest.pt`: Latest model state
  - `checkpoint_best.pt`: Best validation mAP
- `labels.txt`: Species vocabulary (taxonKey → scientific name → common name)
- `training_history.json`: Per-epoch loss, LR, and evaluation metrics
- Evaluation metrics computed during validation:
  - Mean Average Precision (mAP)
  - Top-k recall at k=10 and k=30
  - F1, precision, recall at probability thresholds 5%, 10%, 25%
  - List-ratio and mean list length at the same thresholds
  - Per-species AP for 18 endemic/restricted-range watchlist species
    (Hawaiian, NZ, Galápagos, other), with watchlist mean AP
  - Density-stratified mAP (sparse/dense quartiles by observation density)
  - Prediction-density correlation (Pearson r between obs density and predicted count)
  - Holdout region metrics (mAP, F1@10% on held-out geographic regions)
- `WATCHLIST_SPECIES` dict in train.py maps taxonKeys to common names
- Progress tracking with tqdm
- GPU/CPU support with automatic device selection

  - Bayesian optimization with TPE sampler and MedianPruner
  - `--autotune_trials` (default 50), `--autotune_epochs` (default 10)
  - Results saved to `checkpoints/autotune/autotune_results.json`

**Command-line interface:**
```bash
python train.py \
  --data_path outputs/combined.parquet \
  --model_scale 1.0 \
  --batch_size 256 \
  --num_epochs 100 \
  --lr 0.001 \
  --holdout_regions us_northwest benelux  # optional: mask regions from training
```

### Inference (`predict.py`)

Loads a checkpoint and predicts species probabilities for arbitrary (lat, lon, week) inputs.
Supports top-k filtering and probability thresholding.

### Model Export (`convert.py`)

Converts a PyTorch checkpoint to portable inference formats (ONNX, TFLite, TF SavedModel)
with FP16 and INT8 quantisation options.  Each conversion is automatically validated against
the PyTorch reference model.  Default format is ONNX FP16.

By default, ONNX FP16 exports keep model inputs/outputs in FP32 (`keep_io_fp32=True`)
while converting internal weights to FP16.  LayerNormalization is also kept in FP32 for
numerical stability.  Pass `--fp16_io` to convert I/O tensors to FP16 as well.

### Data Flow

**Training:**
1. Load H3 cell data from parquet → GeoPandas DataFrame
2. Flatten to (cell, week) samples → Extract lat/lon, species, env features
   - `--no_yearly` excludes week-0 samples (recommended for temporal learning)
3. Build species vocabulary → Multi-label sparse encoding
4. Downsample ocean cells (if configured; default: keep all)
5. Cap observations per species (if configured) → Reduce common-species dominance
6. Normalize environmental features → Auxiliary targets
7. Split by location → Train/Val/Test sets
8. Create PyTorch DataLoaders → Batched sampling
   - `--jitter` adds Gaussian noise to training lat/lon (scale from H3 cell size)
8. Training loop:
   - Forward pass: raw (lat, lon, week) → spatial encoding + FiLM temporal conditioning → (species_logits, env_pred)
   - Compute multi-task loss (ASL + MSE)
   - Backward pass with AMP and gradient clipping
   - Update model parameters
9. Save checkpoints periodically and when validation improves

**Inference:**
1. Accept raw (lat, lon, week) input (week 1–48; week 0 = max across all 48)
2. Forward pass through model (encoding is internal)
3. Apply sigmoid → species probabilities
4. Threshold or return top-k species
