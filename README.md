# BirdNET Geomodel
Spatiotemporal species range prediction for detection post-filtering

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and create a Python virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/birdnet-team/geomodel.git
cd geomodel
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. (Linux/Ubuntu) Install system libraries required for building geospatial packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3-dev gdal-bin libgdal-dev libproj-dev proj-data proj-bin libgeos-dev libspatialindex-dev

# Upgrade pip/build tools
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

3. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Notes:

- Installing `geopandas` and related spatial libraries via pip on Linux often requires the GDAL/PROJ/GEOS development headers; step 2 installs commonly-needed packages.
- If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails for a package, install the package individually (for example: `pip install pyproj shapely fiona rtree pyarrow`) to reveal build errors.
- Manylinux wheels typically provide pre-built binaries for packages such as `pyarrow` and `shapely` on common Python versions.

4. Google Earth Engine (EE):

- Sign up at https://earthengine.google.com/ if you don't have an account.
- Authenticate once via `earthengine authenticate` (opens a browser).
- In scripts, call `ee.Initialize()` (the provided `initialize_ee()` helper attempts client or service-account auth).

5. Data sources (optional): iNaturalist and eBird observation archives are used by other scripts; see source links in the project if you need them. Set `WORKING_DIRECTORY` or other paths as needed in your environment.

## Usage

### `geoutils.py`

`utils/geoutils.py` builds H3 hex grids and computes per-cell environmental summaries
by sampling Earth Engine datasets. This repository:

- uses centroid sampling for each H3 cell (fast, approximate).
- processes the H3 set in fixed-size chunks (500 cells per chunk).

Supported output (per H3 cell)

- `water_fraction` — JRC Global Surface Water occurrence (0.0–1.0)
- `elevation_m` — SRTM elevation (meters)
- `precipitation_mm` / `temperature_c` — WorldClim bioclim variables
- `landcover_class` — MODIS LC_Type1
- `canopy_height_m` — canopy height (NASA/JPL)

CLI

- `--km` : Target diameter in km (e.g. 5, 10, 25)
- `--out-dir` : Directory to write per-chunk parquet files (one file per chunk)
- `--bounds` : Optional bbox (LON_MIN LAT_MIN LON_MAX LAT_MAX) to limit processing
- `--threads` : Number of worker threads to use for parallel chunk processing

Notes

- The script chunks (500 cells per chunk) and writes one parquet file
    per chunk into `--out-dir`.
- To reduce EE client-side concurrency warnings, set the environment
    variable `EE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` to a conservative value (e.g. 4–8) before
    running large jobs.

Example (regional run):

```bash
python utils/geoutils.py --km 25 --bounds -10.0 34.0 40.0 72.0 --out-dir outputs/europe_chunks --threads 8
```

Programmatic use

Import `compute_environmental_data` or `run_global_in_chunks` from
`utils.geoutils` to call the functions directly from notebooks or scripts.

### `observations.py`

This script processes iNaturalist and eBird observations, filters them, and saves the results.

1.  **Parsing source data:**

    ```bash
    python observations.py --parse_inat_source --parse_ebird_source
    ```

    **Arguments:**
    *   `--parse_inat_source`: If set, parses the iNaturalist source data.
    *   `--parse_ebird_source`: If set, parses the eBird source data.
